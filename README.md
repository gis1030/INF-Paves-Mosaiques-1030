# Inventory of the mosaic paving stones of the entrances and facades of Schaerbeek
The origin of these pavés goes back to a personal initiative of the artist Ingrid Schreyers, who chose to install a first mosaic on their own. Cet élan artistique a rapidement seduit les Schaerbeekois, devenant une demande récurrente des riverains désireux d’embellir l'espace public et de donner du caractère à leurs rues.

## Details

It was in this spirit that the first map of Schaerbeek's mosaic paving stones was created, thanks to an exemplary synergy between civic engagement and public service. Patrick Bastin documented these works during his walks, and following a collaboration with Richard Robinson of the Roads Technical Department, the idea of ​​officially cataloging them within the municipality became a reality.

By cross-referencing Mr. Bastin's photographic archives with data from projects carried out by the Roads Technical Department, we were able to compile a precise inventory. Today, 243 countries are registered.
